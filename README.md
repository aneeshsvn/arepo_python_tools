# arepo_python_tools
Python package with tools to analyze simulation data from AREPO hydrodynamics simulations

Includes functions to :
generate 2D images of particle properties like Density, Temperature, Velocity, Pressure etc.
calculate and plot radial profiles of all quantities
calculate flux of quantities like mass, momentum etc. of particles using different methods
extract global properties of galaxies from snapshot data
extract BH properties from both snapshot data and black_hole_details.txt files
calculate center of galaxies using iterative shrinking sphere method, regular COM fromula and median position methods.
